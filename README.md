An ethical AI ecosystem inspired by the principles of “gadaana” — street-smart honor, cultural intelligence, and human-first governance.

## What is GadaaNET?

GadaaNET is a value-centered framework for AI and digital governance based on cultural codes of trust, courage, protection, and loyalty.

Instead of building on western rationalist ethics alone, this model integrates social wisdom and dignity-based behavior into AI ecosystems — especially for post-capitalist, decentralized societies.
